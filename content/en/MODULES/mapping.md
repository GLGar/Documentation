Since THIRM VM needs to be atomic, which is why we do not use any local database. To store various mapping we use smart contracts to map all the needed data.


This helps solve following problems

1. Data Integrity - Since all data is mapped one by one, it ensure that der is always order.

2. Abstraction - Keeps VM from taking direct input, thus preventing 100% of hacking attempt or DDOS attacks.

3. Trustless - makes whole environment trustless, everything is on blockchain and can be verified with ease across blockchain.
