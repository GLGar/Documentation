Tokenomics is the study of how cryptocurrencies work within the broader ecosystem. This includes things such as as token distribution as well as how they can be used to incentivize positive behavior. 

## Inflation 

THIRM TOKEN is inflated by the rate of 0.1% every 10 days (3.7155% per year), this expansion goes to UNISWAP Liquidity Pool (THIRM-USDC).

Optional - Depends on users, if they think uniswap Lp is low they can call themself.

## Deflation 

THIRM VM is built with a vision for the future and the THIRM token is the fuel for the THIRM PROTOCOL. For every operation requested, the user needs to burn THIRM, thus deflating the total supply.

## Supply 
All the above-given factors make THIRM's total supply of token a dynamic ever-changing variable (Deflationary), that can always be viewed on our Ethereum contract.
