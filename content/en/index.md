**THIRM** is a protocol that allows users to access cryptocurrency assets between multiple blockchains . 

## Abstract

With the increase in DEFI & lot of apps are being built on various blockchains, but these blockchains run on different codebase which makes using the apps from blockchain A impossible on blockchain B

While lot of DAPPs are being ported accross blockchains but they are limited and might not function the same way as intended on the parent blockchain.

Some blockchians don't support DAPPS as all ( BITCOIN and LITECOIN are good examples), but they do have a store of value and easy of integration and are accepted all over internet as a mode of payment.

So what if a BITCOIN User wants to use a DEX ( decenterlised Exchnages ) on ethereum ? how will he use these app ? he needs a service which will allow him to use his BITCOIN on any other blockchain apps.


Here comes THIRM, a Crosschain Bridge that allows you to use you BITCOIN right on Ethereum. But this is something simple THIRM allows so many blockchains to connect with each other.
